<h2><a name="act1">ACT I</a></h2>

<p class="scene">The entrance hall of a wealthy house in Moscow. There
are three doors: the front door, the door of Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch's
study, and the door of Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch's room. A
staircase leads up to the other rooms; behind it is another
door leading to the servants' quarters.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3 class="smcap">Scene 1.</h3>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY</span> [<i>looks at himself in the glass and arranges his hair,
&amp;c.</i>] I <em>am</em> sorry about those moustaches of mine! &ldquo;Moustaches
are not becoming to a footman,&rdquo; she says! And
why? Why, so that any one might see you're a footman,&mdash;else
my looks might put her darling son to shame. He's
a likely one! There's not much fear of his coming anywhere
near me, moustaches or no moustaches! [<i>Smiling
into the glass</i>] And what a lot of 'em swarm round me.
And yet I don't care for any of them as much as for
that T&aacute;nya. And she only a lady's-maid! Ah well,
she's nicer than any young lady. [<i>Smiles</i>] She is a duck!
[<i>Listening</i>] Ah, here she comes. [<i>Smiles</i>] Yes, that's her,
clattering with her little heels. Oh!</p>

<p><i>Enter T&aacute;nya, carrying a cloak and boots.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> My respects to you, Taty&aacute;na M&aacute;rkovna.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> What are you always looking in the glass for?
Do you think yourself so good-looking?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Well, and are my looks not agreeable?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126">126</a></span>
<span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> So, so; neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but
just betwixt and between! Why are all those cloaks hanging there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> I am just going to put them away, your ladyship!
[<i>Takes down a fur cloak and, wrapping it round her,
embraces her</i>] I say, T&aacute;nya, I'll tell you something&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Oh, get away, do! What do you mean by it?
[<i>Pulls herself angrily away</i>] Leave me alone, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY</span> [<i>looks cautiously around</i>] Then give me a kiss!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Now, really, what are you bothering for? I'll
give you such a kiss! [<i>Raises her hand to strike</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>off the scene, rings and then shouts</i>]
Gregory!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> There now, go! Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch is calling you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> He'll wait! He's only just opened his eyes!
I say, why don't you love me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> What sort of loving have you imagined now? I
don't love anybody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> That's a fib. You love Simon! You have
found a nice one to love&mdash;a common, dirty-pawed peasant,
a butler's assistant!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Never mind; such as he is, you are jealous of
him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>off the scene</i>] Gregory!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> All in good time.&hellip; Jealous indeed! Of
what? Why, you have only just begun to get licked
into shape, and who are you tying yourself up with? Now,
wouldn't it be altogether a different matter if you loved
me?&hellip; I say, T&aacute;nya&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>angrily and severely</i>] You'll get nothing from
me, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>off the scene</i>] Gregory!!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> You're mighty particular, ain't you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>off the scene, shouts persistently, monotonously,
and with all his might</i>] Gregory! Gregory! Gregory!
[<i>T&aacute;nya and Gregory laugh</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127">127</a></span>
<span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> You should have seen the girls that have been
sweet on me. [<i>Bell rings</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well then, go to them, and leave me alone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> You are a silly, now I think of it. I'm not
Simon!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Simon means marriage, and not tomfoolery!</p>

<p><i>Enter Porter, carrying a large cardboard box.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER.</span> Good morning!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Good morning! Where are you from?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER.</span> From Bourdey's. I've brought a dress, and
here's a note for the lady.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>taking the note</i>] Sit down, and I'll take it in.
[<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><i>Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch looks out of the door in shirt-sleeves and
slippers.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Gregory!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Gregory! Don't you hear me call?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> I've only just come, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Hot water, and a cup of tea.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Yes, sir; Simon will bring them directly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> And who is this? Ah, from Bourdier?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Exeunt Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch and Gregory. Bell rings. T&aacute;nya
runs in at the sound of the bell and opens the front door.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>to Porter</i>] Please wait a little.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER.</span> I am waiting.</p>

<p><i>Sah&aacute;tof enters at front door.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I beg your pardon, but the footman has just
gone away. This way, sir. Allow me, please. [<i>Takes his
fur cloak</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>adjusting his clothes</i>] Is Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch at
home? Is he up? [<i>Bell rings</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Oh yes, sir. He's been up a long time.</p>

<p><i>Doctor enters and looks round for the footman. Sees Sah&aacute;tof
and addresses him in an offhand manner.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128">128</a></span>
<span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> Ah, my respects to you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>looks fixedly at him</i>] The Doctor, I believe?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> And I thought you were abroad! Dropped in
to see Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Yes. And you? Is any one ill?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Not exactly ill, but, you know &hellip;
It's awful with these ladies! Sits up at cards till three
every morning, and pulls her waist into the shape of a
wine-glass. And the lady is flabby and fat, and carries
the weight of a good many years on her back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Is this the way you state your diagnosis to
Anna P&aacute;vlovna? I should hardly think it quite pleases her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR</span> [<i>laughing</i>] Well, it's the truth. They do all
these tricks&mdash;and then come derangements of the
digestive organs, pressure on the liver, nerves, and all
sorts of things, and one has to come and patch them up.
It's just awful! [<i>Laughs</i>] And you? You are also a
spiritualist it seems?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> I? No, I am not also a spiritualist.&hellip; Good
morning! [<i>Is about to go, but is stopped by the Doctor</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> No! But I can't myself, you know, positively
deny the possibility of it, when a man like Krougosv&eacute;tlof is
connected with it all. How can one? Is he not a professor,&mdash;a
European celebrity? There must be something
in it. I should like to see for myself, but I never have the
time. I have other things to do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Yes, yes! Good morning. [<i>Exit, bowing slightly</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR</span> [<i>to T&aacute;nya</i>] Is Anna P&aacute;vlovna up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> She's in her bedroom, but please come up.</p>

<p><i>Doctor goes upstairs.</i></p>

<p><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch enters with a newspaper in his hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>to Porter</i>] What is it you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER.</span> I'm from Bourdey's. I brought a dress and a
note, and was told to wait.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Ah, from Bourdey's! [<i>To T&aacute;nya</i>]
Who came in just now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129">129</a></span>
<span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> It was Serg&eacute;y Iv&aacute;nitch Sah&aacute;tof and the Doctor.
They stood talking here a bit. It was all about spiritalism.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>correcting her</i>] Spirit<em>u</em>alism.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Yes, that's just what I said&mdash;spiritalism. Have
you heard how well it went off last time, Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch?
[<i>Laughs</i>] There was knocks, and things flew about!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> And how do <em>you</em> know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Miss Elizabeth told me.</p>

<p><i>Jacob runs in with a tumbler of tea on a tray.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB</span> [<i>to the Porter</i>] Good morning!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER</span> [<i>disconsolately</i>] Good morning!</p>

<p><i>Jacob knocks at Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch's door.</i></p>

<p><i>Gregory enters.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Give it here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> You didn't bring back all yesterday's tumblers,
nor the tray Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch had. And it's me that have
to answer for them!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> The tray is full of cigars.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Well, put them somewhere else. It's me who's
answerable for it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> I'll bring it back! I'll bring it back!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Yes, so you say, but it is not where it ought to
be. The other day, just as the tea had to be served, it
was not to be found.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> I'll bring it back, I tell you. What a fuss!</p>

where?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> From the other world. Yes!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>smiling</i>] That's very interesting&mdash;very interesting!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Well, supposing we admit that I'm
a man carried away by an idea, as you think, and
that I am deluding myself. Well, but what of Alex&eacute;y
Vlad&iacute;miritch Krougosv&eacute;tlof&mdash;he is not just an ordinary
man, but a distinguished professor, and yet he admits it to
be a fact. And not he alone. What of Crookes? What
of Wallace?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> But I don't deny anything. I only say it is
very interesting. It would be interesting to know how

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> He has a theory of his own. Could

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Yes, I have heard of him but have never
happened to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Then you must come! We shall
first have Grossman, then Kaptch&iacute;tch, and our mediumistic

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Not yet, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Then how am I to know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Never mind, come in any case! If
Kaptch&iacute;tch can't come we shall find our own medium.
M&aacute;rya Ign&aacute;tievna is a medium&mdash;not such a good one as
Kaptch&iacute;tch, but still&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><i>T&aacute;nya enters with plates for the presents, and stands listening.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Oh yes, yes. But here is one puzzling
point:&mdash;how is it that the mediums are always of the,
so-called, educated class, such as Kaptch&iacute;tch and M&aacute;rya
Ign&aacute;tievna? If there were such a special force, would it
not be met with also among the common people&mdash;the
peasants?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Oh yes, and it is! That is very
common. Even here in our own house we have a peasant
whom we discovered to be a medium. A few days ago
we called him in&mdash;a sofa had to be moved, during a
s&eacute;ance&mdash;and we forgot all about him. In all probability
he fell asleep. And, fancy, after our s&eacute;ance was over
and Kaptch&iacute;tch had come to again, we suddenly noticed
mediumistic phenomena in another part of the room, near
the peasant: the table gave a jerk and moved!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>aside</i>] That was when I was getting out from
under it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> It is quite evident he also is a
medium. Especially as he is very like Home in appearance.
You remember Home&mdash;a fair-haired na&iuml;ve sort of
fellow?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>] Dear me, this is very
interesting, you know. I think you should try him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> So we will! And he is not alone;
there are thousands of mediums, only we do not know
them. Why, only a short time ago a bedridden old
woman moved a brick wall!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136">136</a></span>
<span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Moved a brick &hellip; a brick wall?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, yes. She was lying in bed,
and did not even know she was a medium. She just leant
her arm against the wall, and the wall moved!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> And did not cave in?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> And did not cave in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Very strange! Well then, I'll come this

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Pray do. We shall have a s&eacute;ance

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it. It comes to this &hellip; I
mean the buying of the property of the land. The Commune
has given us, let's say, the power of atturning, to
enter, let's say, as is lawful, through the Government
bank, with a stamp for the lawful amount.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> You mean that you want to buy the
land through the land-bank.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it. Just as you offered it to us
last year. It comes to this, then, the whole sum in full for
the buying of the property of the land is 32,864 roubles.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> That's all right, but how about
paying up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> As to the payment, the Commune offers

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> The Commune, for example, relied its

it in easy 'stalments&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> That was last year. I would have

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Of course it's quite true, that I

again</i>] What are we to do now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> What is your business, then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Our business, respected sir, depends in
this. Last year he made us the offer of our buying the
land in 'stalments. The Commune entered upon these
terms and gave us the powers of atturning, and now d'you
see he makes the offering that we should pay the whole
in full! And as it turns out, the business is no ways convenient
for us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> What is the whole sum?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> The whole sum in readiness is 4000
roubles, you see.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Well, what of that? Make an
effort and collect more.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Such as it is, it was collected with much
effort. We have, so to say, in this sense, not got ammunition
enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> You can't get blood out of a stone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> We'd be glad with all our hearts, but
we have swept even this together, as you might say,
with a broom.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> I have told you already I'll do my

[<i>The Peasants bow</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>looking at Porter, to Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>]
Why don't you attend to this fellow from Bourdier? He
hasn't come to take lodgings with us, has he? Just look,
he is asleep! Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> The note he brought has been sent
in, and he has been told to wait until Anna P&aacute;vlovna
comes down.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>looks at Peasants and notices the money</i>]
And what is this? Money? For whom? Is it for us?
[<i>To Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>] Who are they?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> They are peasants from Koursk.
They are buying land.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Has it been sold them?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> No, they have not yet come to any
agreement. They are too stingy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Eh? Well, we must try and persuade
them. [<i>To the Peasants</i>] Here, I say, are you buying
land? Eh?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it. We have made an offering
as how we should like to acquire the possession of the
land.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Then you should not be so stingy,
you know. Just let me tell you how necessary land is to
peasants! Eh, what? It's very necessary, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141">141</a></span>
<span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it. The land appears as the
very first and foremost necessity to a peasant. That's
just it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Then why be so stingy? Just you
think what land is! Why, one can sow wheat on it in
rows! I tell you, you could get eighty bushels of wheat,
at a rouble and a half a bushel&mdash;that would be 120 roubles.
Eh, what? Or else mint! I tell you, you could collar
400 roubles off an acre by sowing mint!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it. All sorts of producks one
could put into action if one had the right understanding.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Mint! Decidedly mint! I have
learnt about it, you know. It's all printed in books. I
can show them you. Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it, all concerns are clearer to
you through your books. That's learnedness, of course.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Then pay up and don't be <ins title="stingy">stingy.</ins>
[<i>To Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>] Where's papa?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> He gave orders not to be disturbed
just now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Oh, I suppose he's consulting a spirit
whether to sell the land or not? Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> I can't say. All I know is that he
went away undecided about it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> What d'you think, Theodore <ins title="Ivan&iacute;tch">Iv&aacute;nitch</ins>,
is he flush of cash? Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> I don't know. I hardly think <ins title="so,">so.</ins>
But what does it matter to you? You drew a good sum
not more than a week ago.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> But didn't I pay for those dogs?
And now, you know, there's our new Society, and Petr&iacute;stchef
has been chosen, and I had borrowed money from
Petr&iacute;stchef and must pay the subscription both for him
and for myself. Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> And what is this new Society? A
Cycling Club?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142">142</a></span>
<span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> No. Just let me tell you. It is quite
a new Society. It is a very serious Society, you know. And
who do you think is President? Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> What's the object of this new
Society?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> It is a &ldquo;Society to Promote the
Breeding of Pure-bred Russian Hounds.&rdquo; Eh, what?
And I'll tell you, they're having the first meeting and a
lunch, to-day. And I've no money. I'll go to him and
have a try! [<i>Exit through study door</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT</span> [<i>to Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>] And who might he
be, respected sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>smiles</i>] The young master.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> The heir, so to say. Oh Lord! [<i>puts

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> And we were told he was in military

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> No, as an only son he is exempt
from military service.</p>

That's right!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT</span> [<i>shaking his head</i>] He's the right sort.

a Society with serious and noble aims has been founded, I
can't even have 300 roubles to go on with!&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> I tell you I can't do it, and I can't!

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> You'd better ask mamma. She doesn't grudge
Vovo 500 roubles for his dogs, but 100 is too much for a

spent the night heaven knows where!&hellip; [<i>Getting more
and more excited</i>] I daresay every fold of their clothes is
full of microbes&mdash;of scarlet-fever microbes, of smallpox
microbes, of diphtheria microbes! Why, they are from
Koursk Government, where there is an epidemic of diphtheria
&hellip; Doctor! Doctor! Call the doctor back!</p>

<p><i>Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch goes into his room and shuts the door.

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>smokes at the Peasants</i>] Never mind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149">149</a></span>mamma; if you like I'll fumigate them so that all the
microbes will go to pot! Eh, what?</p>

<p><i>Anna P&aacute;vlovna remains severely silent, awaiting the Doctor's
return.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>to Peasants</i>] And do you fatten pigs?
There's a first-rate business!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just so. We do go in for the
pig-fattening line now and then.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> This kind?&hellip; [<i>Grunts like a pig</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Vovo, Vovo, leave off!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Isn't it like? Eh, what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just so. It's very resemblant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Vovo, leave off, I tell you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> What's it all about?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> I said, we'd better go to some lodging
meanwhile!</p>

<p><i>Enter Doctor and Gregory.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> What's the matter? What's happened?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Why, you're always saying I must not
get excited. Now, how is it possible to keep calm? I
do not see my own sister for two months, and am careful
about any doubtful visitor&mdash;and here are people from
Koursk, straight from Koursk, where there is an epidemic
of diphtheria, right in my house!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> These good fellows you mean, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Of course. Straight from a diphtheric
place!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> Well, of course, if they come from an infected
place it is rash; but still there is no reason to excite yourself
so much about it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> But don't you yourself advise carefulness?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> Of course, of course. Still, why excite yourself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> How can I help it? Now we shall
have to have the house completely disinfected.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> Oh no! Why completely? That would cost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150">150</a></span>300 roubles or more. I'll arrange it cheaply and well for
you. Take, to a large bottle of water&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Boiled?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> It's all the same. Boiled would be better. To
one bottle of water take a tablespoon of salicylic acid, and
have everything they have come in contact with washed
with the solution. As to the fellows themselves, they
must be off, of course. That's all. Then you're quite
safe. And it would do no harm to sprinkle some of the
same solution through a spray&mdash;two or three tumblers&mdash;you'll
see how well it will act. No danger whatever!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> T&aacute;nya! Where is T&aacute;nya?</p>

<p><i>Enter T&aacute;nya.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Did you call, M'm?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> You know that big bottle in my dressing-room?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Out of which we sprinkled the laundress yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, of course! What other bottle
could I mean? Well then, take that bottle and first
wash with soap the place where they have been standing,
and then with&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Yes, M'm; I know how.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> And then take the spray &hellip; However,
I had better do that myself when I get back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> Well then, do so, and don't be afraid! Well,

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> And they must be off! Not a trace of

you looking at?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just so. It's because of our

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Ah, from Bourdier? [<i>Excitedly</i>] None!
None! You can take it back. I told her I never ordered
such a costume, and I will not allow my daughter to

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER.</span> I know nothing about it. I was sent&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH</span> [<i>solemnly</i>] Sir Messenger from Bourdier,

<p><span class="speaker">PORTER.</span> I might have been told that long ago. I have

<p><i>Enter Petr&iacute;stchef, Betsy, and M&aacute;rya Konstant&iacute;novna.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> You always keep one waiting!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> On the contrary, I was waiting for you!</p>

<p><i>Petr&iacute;stchef bows with his head only, then kisses Anna P&aacute;vlovna's

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> How d'you do! [<i>To Betsy</i>] You always
have an answer ready!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> If you are upset, mamma, I had better not go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Are we going or not?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> Well, let us go; it can't be helped.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Did you see the man from Bourdier?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> Yes, and I was very glad. I ordered the costume,
and am going to wear it when it is paid for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152">152</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> I am not going to pay for a costume
that is indecent!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> Why has it become indecent? First it was
decent, and now you have a fit of prudery.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Not prudery at all! If the bodice were
completely altered, then it would do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> Mamma, that is quite impossible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, get dressed. [<i>They sit down.

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> M&aacute;rya Konstant&iacute;novna, do you notice
a vacuum in the hall?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">M&Aacute;RYA KONSTANT&Iacute;NOVNA.</span> What is it? [<i>Laughs in anticipation</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Bourdier's man has gone! Eh,
what? Good, eh? [<i>Laughs loudly</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Well, let us go. [<i>Goes out of the door, but

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Yes, M'm?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Don't let Frisk catch cold while I am
away. If she wants to be let out, put on her little yellow

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Yes, M'm.</p>

<p><i>Exeunt Anna P&aacute;vlovna, Betsy, and Gregory.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETR&Iacute;STCHEF.</span> Well, have you got it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">VAS&Iacute;LY LEON&Iacute;DITCH.</span> Not without trouble, I can tell you!
First I rushed at the gov'nor; he began to bellow and
turned me out. Off to the mater&mdash;I got it out of her.
It's here! [<i>Slaps his breast pocket</i>] If once I make up my
mind, there's no getting away from me. I have a deadly
grip! Eh, what? And d'you know, my wolf-hounds are
coming to-day.</p>

<p><i>Petr&iacute;stchef and Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch put on their outdoor things
and go out. T&aacute;nya follows.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>alone</i>] Yes, nothing but unpleasantness.
How is it they can't live in peace? But one
must say the new generation are not&mdash;the thing. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153">153</a></span>as to the women's dominion!&hellip; Why, Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch
just now was going to put in a word, but seeing what a
frenzy she was in&mdash;slammed the door behind him. He
is a wonderfully kind-hearted man. Yes, wonderfully
kind. What's this? Here's T&aacute;nya bringing them back
again!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Come in, come in, grand-dads, never mind!</p>

<p><i>Enter T&aacute;nya and the Peasants.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Why have you brought them back?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well, Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch, we must do something
about their business. I shall have to wash the place anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> But the business will not come off,
I see that already.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> How could we best put our affair into
action, respected sir? Your reverence might take a little
trouble over it, and we should give you full thankings
from the Commune for your trouble.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Do try, honey! We can't live! We
have so little land. Talk of cattle&mdash;why, we have no room
to keep a hen! [<i>They bow</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> I am sorry for you, friends, but I
can't think of any way to help you. I understand your
case very well, but he has refused. So what can one do?
Besides, the lady is also against it. Well, give me your
papers&mdash;I'll try and see what I can do, but I hardly hope
to succeed. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><i>T&aacute;nya and the three Peasants sigh.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> But tell me, grand-dads, what is it that is
wanted?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Why, only that he should put his signature
to our document.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> That the master should sign? Is that all?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Yes, only lay his signature on the deed
and take the money, and there would be an end of the
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154">154</a></span>
<span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> He only has to write and sign, as the
peasants, let's say, desire, so, let's say, I also desire.
That's the whole affair&mdash;if he'd only take it and sign it,
it's all done.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>considering</i>] He need only sign the paper and
it's done?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just so. The whole matter is in
dependence on that, and nothing else. Let him sign,
and we ask no more.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Just wait and see what Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch will
say. If he cannot persuade the master, I'll try something.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Get round him, will you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I'll try.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Ay, the lass is going to bestir herself.
Only get the thing settled, and the Commune will bind
itself to keep you all your life. See there, now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> If the affair can be put into action, truly
we might put her in a gold frame.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> That goes without saying!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I can't promise for certain, but as the saying is:
&ldquo;An attempt is no sin, if you try&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> &ldquo;You may win.&rdquo; That's just so.</p>

<p><i>Enter Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> No, friends, it's no go! He has not
done it, and he won't do it. Here, take your document.
You may go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT</span> [<i>gives T&aacute;nya the paper</i>] Then it's on you
we pin all our reliance, for example.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Yes, yes! You go into the street, and I'll run
out to you in a minute and have a word with you.</p>

<p><i>Exeunt Peasants.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch, dear Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch, ask
the master to come out and speak to me for a moment.
I have something to say to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> What next?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155">155</a></span>
<span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I must, Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch. Ask him, do; there's
nothing wrong about it, on my sacred word.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> But what do you want with him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> That's a little secret. I will tell you later on,
only ask him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>smiling</i>] I can't think what you are
up to! All right, I'll go and ask him. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I'll do it! Didn't he say himself that there is
that power in Simon? And I know how to manage. No
one found me out that time, and now I'll teach Simon
what to do. If it doesn't succeed it's no great matter.
After all it's not a sin.</p>

<p><i>Enter Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch followed by Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Is this the petitioner?
Well, what is your business?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> It's a little secret, Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch; let me
tell it you alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> What is it? Theodore, leave us
for a minute.</p>

<p><i>Exit Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> As I have grown up and lived in your house,
Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch, and as I am very grateful to you for
everything, I shall open my heart to you as to a father.
Simon, who is living in your house, wants to marry me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> So that's it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I open my heart to you as to a father! I have
no one to advise me, being an orphan.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Well, and why not? He seems a
nice lad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Yes, that's true. He would be all right; there
is only one thing I have my doubts about. It's something
about him that I have noticed and can't make out &hellip;
perhaps it is something bad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> What is it? Does he drink?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> God forbid! But since I know that there is
such a thing as spiritalism&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156">156</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Ah, you know that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Of course! I understand it very well. Some,
of course, through ignorance, don't understand it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Well, what then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I am very much afraid for Simon. It does
happen to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> What happens to him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Something of a kind like spiritalism. You ask
any of the servants. As soon as he gets drowsy at the
table, the table begins to tremble, and creak like that:
<em>tuke, &hellip; tuke</em>! All the servants have heard it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Why, it's the very thing I was
saying to Serg&eacute;y Iv&aacute;nitch this morning! Yes?&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Or else &hellip; when was it?&hellip; Oh yes, last
Wednesday. We sat down to dinner, and the spoon just
jumps into his hand of itself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Ah, that is interesting! Jumps
into his hand? When he was drowsing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> That I didn't notice. I think he was, though.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes?&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> And that's what I'm afraid of, and what I wanted
to ask you about. May not some harm come of it? To
live one's life together, and him having such a thing in
him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH</span> [<i>smiling</i>] No, you need not be afraid,
there is nothing bad in that. It only proves him to be a
<em>medium</em>&mdash;simply a medium. I knew him to be a medium
before this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> So that's what it is! And I was afraid!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> No, there's nothing to be afraid of.
[<i>Aside</i>]. That's capital! Kaptch&iacute;tch can't come, so we
will test him to-night.&hellip; [<i>To T&aacute;nya</i>] No, my dear,
don't be afraid, he will be a good husband and &hellip; that
is only a kind of special power, and every one has it, only
in some it is weaker and in others stronger.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Thank you, sir. Now I shan't think any more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157">157</a></span>about it; but I was so frightened.&hellip; What a thing it
is, our want of education!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> No, no, don't be frightened&hellip;
Theodore!</p>

<p><i>Enter Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> I am going out now. Get everything
ready for to-night's s&eacute;ance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> But Mr. Kaptch&iacute;tch is not coming.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> That does not matter. [<i>Puts on overcoat</i>]
We shall have a trial s&eacute;ance with our own medium.
[<i>Exit. Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch goes out with him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>alone</i>] He believes it! He believes it! [<i>Shrieks
and jumps with joy</i>] He really believes it! Isn't it wonderful!
[<i>Shrieks</i>] Now I'll do it, if only Simon has pluck
for it!</p>

<p><i>Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch returns.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Well, have you told him your secret?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I'll tell you too, only later on.&hellip; But I have a
favour to ask of you too, Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Yes? What is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>shyly</i>] You have been a second father to me,
and I will open my heart before you as before God.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Don't beat about the bush, but
come straight to the point.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> The point is &hellip; well, the point is, that Simon
wants to marry me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Is that it? I thought I noticed&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well, why should I hide it? I am an orphan,
and you know yourself how matters are in these town
establishments. Every one comes bothering; there's that
Gregory Mih&aacute;ylitch, for instance, he gives me no peace.
And also that other one &hellip; you know. They think I
have no soul, and am only here for their amusement.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Good girl, that's right! Well, what
then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well, Simon wrote to his father; and he, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158">158</a></span>father, sees me to-day, and says: &ldquo;He's spoilt&rdquo;&mdash;he means
his son. Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch [<i>bows</i>], take the place of a
father to me, speak to the old man,&mdash;to Simon's father! I
could take them into the kitchen, and you might come
in and speak to the old man!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Then I am to turn match-maker&mdash;am
I? Well, I can do that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch, dearest, be a father to me,
and I'll pray for you all my life long.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> All right, all right, I'll come later on.
Haven't I promised? [<i>Takes up newspaper</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> You are a second father to me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> All right, all right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Then I'll rely on you. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>alone, shaking his head</i>] A good affectionate
girl. To think that so many like her perish!
Get but once into trouble and she'll go from hand to
hand until she sinks into the mire, and can never be found
again! There was that dear little Nataly. She, too, was
a good girl, reared and cared for by a mother. [<i>Takes up

<h2>ACT II</h2>

<p class="scene">Evening of the same day. The scene represents the interior
of the servants' kitchen. The Peasants have taken off their
outer garments and sit drinking tea at the table, and perspiring.
Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch is smoking a cigar at the other side of the
stage. The discharged Cook is lying on the brick oven, and is
unseen during the early part of the scene.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> My advice is, don't hinder him! If
it's his wish and hers, in Heaven's name let him do it.
She is a good, honest girl. Never mind her being a bit
dressy; she can't help that, living in town: she is a good
girl all the same.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Well, of course, if it is his wish, let him!
<em>He'll</em> have to live with her, not me. But she's certainly
uncommon spruce. How's one to take her into one's
hut? Why, she'll not let her mother-in-law so much as
pat her on the head.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> That does not depend on the spruceness,
but on character. If her nature is good, she's sure
to be docile and respectful.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Ah, well, we'll have her if the lad's
bent on having her. After all, it's a bad job to live with
one as one don't care for. I'll consult my missus, and then
may Heaven bless them!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Then let's shake hands on it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Well, it seems it will have to come off.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Eh, Zachary! fortune's a-smiling on you!
You've come to accomplish a piece of business, and just
see what a duchess of a daughter-in-law you've obtained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160">160</a></span>All that's left to be done is to have a drink on it, and
then it will be all in order.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> That's not at all necessary. [<i>An
awkward silence</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> I know something of your way of
life too, you know. I am even thinking of purchasing a
bit of land, building a cottage, and working on the land
myself somewhere: maybe in your neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> A very good thing too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it. When one has got the
money one can get all kinds of pleasure in the country.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Say no more about it! Country life,
let's say, is freer in every way, not like the town!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> There now, would you let me join
your Commune if I settled among you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Why not? If you stand drink for the
Elders, they'll accept you soon enough!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> And if you open a public-house, for
example, or an inn, why, you'd have such a life you'd
never need to die! You might live like a king, and no
mistake.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Well, we'll see. I should certainly
like to have a few quiet years in my old age. Though my
life here is good enough, and I should be sorry to leave.
Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch is an exceedingly kind-hearted man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it. But how about our business?
Is it possible that he is going to leave it without
any termination?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> He'd do it willingly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> It seems he's afraid of his wife.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> It's not that he's afraid, but they
don't hit things off together.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> But you should try, father! How are
we to live else? We've so little land&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> We'll see what comes of T&aacute;nya's
attempt. She's taken the business into her hands now!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161">161</a></span>
<span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT</span> [<i>takes a sip of tea</i>] Father, be merciful.
We've so little land. A hen, let's say, we've no room for
a hen, let alone the cattle.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> If the business depended on me.&hellip;
[<i>To Second Peasant</i>] Well, friend, so we've done
our bit of match-making! It's agreed then about
T&aacute;nya?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> I've given my word, and I'll not go
back on it without a good reason. If only our business
succeeds!</p>

<p><i>Enter Servants' Cook who looks up at the oven, makes a sign,
and then begins to speak animatedly to Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Just now Simon was called upstairs from
the front kitchen! The master and that other bald-headed
one who calls up spirits with him, ordered him to
sit down and take the place of Kaptch&iacute;tch!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> You don't say so!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Yes, Jacob told T&aacute;nya.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Extraordinary!</p>

<p><i>Enter Coachman.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COACHMAN</span> [<i>to Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch</i>] You may just tell them
I never agreed to live with a lot of dogs! Let any one
who likes do it, but I will never agree to live among dogs!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> What dogs?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COACHMAN.</span> Three dogs have been sent into our room by
Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch! They've messed it all over. They're
whining, and if one comes near them they bite&mdash;the
devils! They'd tear you to pieces if you didn't mind.
I've a good mind to take a club and smash their legs for
them!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> But when did they come?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COACHMAN.</span> Why, to-day, from the Dog Show; the devil
knows what kind they are, but they're an expensive sort.
Are we or the dogs to live in the coachmen's quarters?
You just go and ask!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162">162</a></span>
<span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Yes, that will never do. I'll go
and ask about it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COACHMAN.</span> They'd better be brought here to <ins title="Louk&eacute;rya">Louk&eacute;rya.</ins></p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK</span> [<i>angrily</i>] People have to eat here, and
you'd like to lock dogs in here! As it is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COACHMAN.</span> And I've got the liveries, and the sledge-covers
and the harness there, and they expect things kept
clean! Perhaps the porter's lodge might do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> I must ask Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COACHMAN</span> [<i>angrily</i>] He'd better hang the brutes round
his neck and lug them about with him! But no fear: he'd
rather ride on horseback himself. It's he as spoilt Beauty
without rhyme or reason. That was a horse!&hellip; Oh
dear! what a life! [<i>Exit, slamming door</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> That's not right! Certainly not
right! [<i>To Peasants</i>] Well then, it's time we were saying
good-bye, friends.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PEASANTS.</span> Good-bye!</p>

<p><i>Exit Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch.</i></p>

<p><i>As soon as he is gone a sound of groaning is heard from the
top of the oven.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> He's sleek, that one; looks like a general.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Rather! Why, he has a room all to
himself; he gets his washing, his tea and sugar, and food
from the master's table.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DISCHARGED COOK</span> [<i>on the oven</i>]. Why shouldn't the old
beggar live well? He's lined his pockets all right!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Who's that up there, on the oven?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Oh, it's only a man.</p>

<p><i>Silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Well, and you too, as I noticed a while
since when you were supping, have capital food to eat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> We can't complain. She's not mean
about the food. We have wheat bread every Sunday, and
fish when a holiday happens to be a fast-day too, and
those who like may eat meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163">163</a></span>
<span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> And does any one tuck into flesh on
fast-days?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Oh, they nearly all do! Only the old
coachman&mdash;not the one who was here just now but the
old one&mdash;and Simon, and I and the housekeeper, fast&mdash;all
the others eat meat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> And the master himself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Catch him! Why, I bet he's forgotten
there is such a thing as fasting!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's the gentlefolks' way: they have
got it all out of their books. 'Cos of their intelex!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Shouldn't wonder if they feed on wheat
bread every day!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Wheat bread indeed! Much they think
of wheat bread! You should see what food they eat. No
end of different things!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> In course gentlefolks' food is of an airial
kind.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Airial, of course, but all the same they're
good at stuffing themselves, they are!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Have healthy appekites, so to say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> 'Cos they always rinse it down! All
with sweet wines, and spirits, and fizzy liquors. They
have a different one to suit every kind of food. They eat
and rinse it down, and eat and rinse it down, they do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> And so the food's floated down in proportion,
so to say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Ah yes, they are good at stuffing! It's
awful! You see, it's not just sitting down, eating, then
saying grace and going away&mdash;they're always at it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Like pigs with their feet in the trough!
[<i>Peasants laugh</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> As soon as, by God's grace, they have
opened their eyes, the samov&aacute;r is brought in&mdash;tea, coffee,
chocolate. Hardly is the second samov&aacute;r emptied, a third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164">164</a></span>has to be set. Then lunch, then dinner, then again
coffee. They've hardly left off, then comes tea, and all
sorts of tit-bits and sweetmeats&mdash;there's never an end to
it! They even lie in bed and eat!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> There now; that's good! [<i>Laughs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST AND SECOND PEASANTS.</span> What are you about?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> If I could only live a single day like
that!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> But when do they do their work?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Work indeed! What is their work?
Cards and piano&mdash;that's all their work. The young lady
used to sit down to the piano as soon as she opened her
eyes, and off she'd go! And that other one who lives
here, the teacher, stands and waits. &ldquo;When will the
piano be free?&rdquo; When one has finished, off rattles the
other, and sometimes they'd put two pianos near one
another and four of 'em would bust out at once. Bust
out in such a manner, you could hear 'em down here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Well, and that's all the work they do!
Piano or cards! As soon as they have met together&mdash;cards,
wine, smoking, and so on all night long. And as
soon as they are up: eating again!</p>

<p><i>Enter Simon.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Hope you're enjoying your tea!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Come and join us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON</span> [<i>comes up to the table</i>] Thank you kindly. [<i>First
Peasant pours out a cup of tea for him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Where have you been?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Well, and what was being done there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Why, I couldn't make it out at all! I don't
know how to explain it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> But what was it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> I can't explain it. They have been trying some
kind of strength in me. I can't make it out. T&aacute;nya says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165">165</a></span>&ldquo;Do it, and we'll get the land for our peasants; he'll sell
it them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> But how is she going to manage it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> I can't make it out, and she won't say. She
says, &ldquo;Do as I tell you,&rdquo; and that's all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> But what is it you have to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Nothing just now. They made me sit down,
put out the lights and told me to sleep. And T&aacute;nya had
hidden herself there. They didn't see her, but I did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Why? What for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> The Lord only knows&mdash;I can't make it out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Naturally it is for the distraction of time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Well, it's clear you and I can make
nothing of it. You had better tell me whether you have
taken all your wages yet.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> No, I've not drawn any. I have twenty-eight
roubles to the good, I think.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> That's all right! Well, if God grants
that we get the land, I'll take you home, Simon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> With all my heart!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> You've got spoilt, I should say. You'll
not want to plough?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Plough? Only give me the chance! Plough or
mow,&mdash;I'm game. Those are things one doesn't forget.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> But it don't seem very desirous after
town life, for example? Eh!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> It's good enough for me. One can live in the
country too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> And Daddy M&iacute;try here, is already on the
look-out for your place; he's hankering after a life of
luckshury!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Eh, Daddy M&iacute;try, you'd soon get sick of it. It
seems easy enough when one looks at it, but there's a lot
of running about that takes it out of one.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> You should see one of their balls,
Daddy M&iacute;try, then you would be surprised!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166">166</a></span>
<span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Why, do they eat all the time?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> My eye! You should have seen what
we had here awhile ago. Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch took me
upstairs and I peeped in. The ladies&mdash;awful! Dressed
up! Dressed up, bless my heart, and all bare down to
here, and their arms bare.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Faugh! How beastly!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> I take it the climate allows of that sort
of thing!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Well, daddy, so I peeped in. Dear
me, what it was like! All of 'em in their natural skins!
Would you believe it: old women&mdash;our mistress, only
think, she's a grandmother, and even she'd gone and
bared her shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> And what next? The music strikes up,
and each man of 'em went up to his own, catches hold
of her, and off they go twirling round and round!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> The old women too?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Yes, the old ones too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> No, the old ones sit still.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Get along,&mdash;I've seen it myself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> No they don't.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DISCHARGED COOK</span> [<i>in a hoarse voice, looking down from the
oven</i>] That's the Polka-Mazurka. You fools don't understand
what dancing is. The way they dance&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Shut up, you dancer! And keep quiet&mdash;there's
some one coming.</p>

<p><i>Enter Gregory; old Cook hides hurriedly.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY</span> [<i>to Servants' Cook</i>] Bring some sour cabbage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> I am only just up from the cellar, and
now I must go down again! Who is it for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> For the young ladies. Be quick, and send it
up with Simon. I can't wait!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> There now, they tuck into sweetmeats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167">167</a></span>till they are full up, and then they crave for sour cabbage!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's to make a clearance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> Of course, and as soon as there is room
inside, they begin again! [<i>Takes basin, and exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY</span> [<i>at Peasants</i>] Look at them, how they've established
themselves down here! Mind, if the mistress finds
it out she'll give it you hot, like she did this morning!
[<i>Exit, laughing</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> That's just it, she did raise a storm that
time&mdash;awful!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> That time it looked as if the master
was going to step in, but seeing that the missus was about
to blow the very roof off the house, he slams the door.
Have your own way, thinks he.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT</span> [<i>waving his arm</i>] It's the same everywhere.
My old woman, let's say, she kicks up such a
rumpus sometimes&mdash;it's just awful! Then I just get out
of the hut. Let her go to Jericho! She'll give you one
with the poker if you don't mind. Oh Lord!</p>

<p><i>Jacob enters hurriedly with a prescription.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Here, Simon, you run to the chemist's and get
these powders for the mistress!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> But master told me not to go out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> You've plenty of time; your business won't begin
till after their tea. Hope you are enjoying your tea!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Thanks, come and join us.</p>

<p><i>Exit Simon.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> I haven't time. However, I'll just have one cup
for company's sake.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> And we've just been having a conversation
as to how your mistress carried on so haughty this
morning.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Oh, she's a reg'lar fury! So hot-tempered, that
she gets quite beside herself. Sometimes she even bursts
out crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168">168</a></span>
<span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Now, there's a thing I wanted to ask
you about. What, for example, be these mikerots she was
illuding to erewhile? &ldquo;They've infested the house with
mikerots, with mikerots,&rdquo; she says. What is one to make
of these same mikerots?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Mikerogues, you mean! Well, it seems there is
such a kind of bugs; all illnesses come from them, they
say. So she says there are some of 'em on you. After
you were gone, they washed and washed and sprinkled
the place where you had stood. There's a kind of physic
as kills these same bugs, they say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Then where have we got these bugs
on us?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB</span> [<i>drinking his tea</i>] Why, they say they're so small
that one can't see 'em even through a glass.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Then how does she know I've got 'em on
me? Perhaps there's more of that muck on her than on me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> There now, you go and ask her!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> I believe it's humbug.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Of course it's bosh. The doctors must invent
something, or else what are they paid for? There's one
comes to us every day. Comes,&mdash;talks a bit,&mdash;and pockets
ten roubles!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Why, there's one as takes a hundred!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> A hundred? Humbug!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> A hundred. Humbug, you say? Why, if he
has to go out of town, he'll not do it for less than a thousand!
&ldquo;Give a thousand,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;or else you may

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Oh Lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> Then does he know some charm?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> I suppose he must. I served at a General's outside
Moscow once: a cross, terrible proud old fellow he
was&mdash;just awful. Well, this General's daughter fell ill.
They send for that doctor at once. &ldquo;A thousand roubles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169">169</a></span>then I'll come.&rdquo; Well, they agreed, and he came. Then
they did something or other he didn't like, and he
bawled out at the General and says, &ldquo;Is this the way you
show your respect for me? Then I'll not attend her!&rdquo;
And, oh my! The old General forgot all his pride,
and starts wheedling him in every way not to chuck
up the job!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> And he got the thousand?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Of course!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> That's easy got money. What wouldn't
a peasant do with such a sum!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> And I think it's all bosh. That time
my foot was festering I had it doctored ever so long. I
spent nigh on five roubles on it,&mdash;then I gave up doctoring,
and it got all right!</p>

<p><i>Discharged Cook on the oven coughs.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Ah, the old crony is here again!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Who might that man be?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> He used to be our master's cook. He comes to
see Louk&eacute;rya.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST PEASANT.</span> Kitchen-master, as one might say. Then,
does he live here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> No, they won't allow that. He's here one day,
there another. If he's got a copper he goes to a dosshouse;
but when he has drunk all, he comes here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND PEASANT.</span> How did he come to this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Simply grew weak. And what a man he used
to be&mdash;like a gentleman! Went about with a gold watch;
got forty roubles a month wages. And now look at him!
He'd have starved to death long ago if it hadn't been for
Louk&eacute;rya.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171">171</a></span>here. How is she? What is she like? How is she

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> She's a nice girl; one can say nothing but good
of her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> I'll tell you straight, daddy; I know
this here establishment out and out, and if you mean to
have T&aacute;nya for your son's wife&mdash;be quick about it, before
she comes to grief, or else she'll not escape!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">JACOB.</span> Yes, that's true. A while ago we had a girl here,
Nataly. She was a good girl too. And she was lost
without rhyme or reason. No better than that chap!
[<i>Pointing to the old Cook</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SERVANTS' COOK.</span> There's enough to dam a mill-pool,
with the likes of us, as perish! 'Cos why, every one is
tempted by the easy life and the good food. And see
there,&mdash;as soon as one has tasted the good food she goes
and slips. And once she's slipped, they don't want her,
but get a fresh one in her place. So it was with dear
little Nataly; she also slipped, and they turned her out.
She had a child and fell ill, and died in the hospital last
spring. And what a girl she used to be!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THIRD PEASANT.</span> Oh Lord! People are weak; they
ought to be pitied.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DISCHARGED COOK.</span> Those devils pity? No fear! [<i>He

went in his sledge to bury that dog. Well, he buried it, and

Well, there was such a bitter frost that the coachman's

hand; we'll see, we'll see. [<i>Takes out his watch, and feels
Grossman's pulse</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY</span> [<i>to Grossman</i>] One moment! The condition
you were in could not be called sleep?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN</span> [<i>wearily</i>] It was hypnosis.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> In that case, are we to understand that you
hypnotised yourself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN.</span> And why not? An hypnotic state may ensue
not only in consequence of association&mdash;the sound of the
tom-tom, for instance, in Charcot's method&mdash;but by merely
entering an hypnogenetic zone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182">182</a></span>
<span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Granting that, it would still be desirable to
define what hypnotism is, more exactly?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Hypnotism is a phenomenon resulting from
the transmutation of one energy into another.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN.</span> Charcot does not so define it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> A moment, just a moment! That is your
definition, but Li&eacute;bault told me himself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR</span> [<i>lets go of Grossman's pulse</i>] Ah, that's all right;
well now, the temperature?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] No, allow me! I agree with the
Professor. And here's the very best proof. After my
illness, when I lay insensible, a desire to speak came over
me. In general I am of a silent disposition, but then
I was overcome by this desire to speak, and I spoke and
spoke, and I was told that I spoke in such a way that
every one was astonished! [<i>To Sah&aacute;tof</i>] But I think I
interrupted you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>with dignity</i>] Not at all. Pray continue.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> Pulse 82, and the temperature has risen three-tenths
of a degree.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> There you are! That's a proof! That's just
as it should be. [<i>Takes out pocket-book and writes</i>] 82, yes?
And 37 and 5. When the hypnotic state is induced, it
invariably produces a heightened action of the heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> I can, as a medical man, bear witness that your
prognosis was justified by the event.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>to Sah&aacute;tof</i>] You were saying?&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> I wished to say that Li&eacute;bault told me himself
that the hypnotic is only one particular psychical
state, increasing susceptibility to suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> That is so, but still the law of equivalents is
the chief thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN.</span> Moreover, Li&eacute;bault is far from being an
authority, while Charcot has studied the subject from all
sides, and has proved that hypnotism produced by a blow,

<h2>ACT III</h2>

<p class="scene">Evening of the same day. The small drawing-room in
Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch's house, where the s&eacute;ances are always held.
Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch and the Professor.</p>


<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Well then, shall we risk a s&eacute;ance
with our new medium?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Yes, certainly. He is a powerful medium,
there is no doubt about it. And it is especially desirable
that the s&eacute;ance should take place to-day with the
same people. Grossman will certainly respond to the
influence of the mediumistic energy, and then the connection
and identity of the different phenomena will
be still more evident. You will see then that, if the
medium is as strong as he was just now, Grossman will
vibrate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Then I will send for Simon and ask
those who wish to attend to come in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Yes, all right! I will just jot down a few
notes. [<i>Takes out his note-book and writes</i>].</p>

<p><i>Enter Sah&aacute;tof.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> They have just settled down to whist in Anna
P&aacute;vlovna's drawing-room, and as I am not wanted there&mdash;and
as I am interested in your s&eacute;ance&mdash;I have put in
an appearance here. But will there be a s&eacute;ance?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, certainly!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> In spite of the absence of Mr. Kaptch&iacute;tch's
mediumistic powers?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous avez la main heureuse.</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Fancy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186">186</a></span>that very peasant whom I mentioned to you this morning,
turns out to be an undoubted medium.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Dear me! Yes, that is peculiarly interesting!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, we tried a few preliminary
experiments with him just after dinner.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> So you've had time already to experiment, and
to convince yourself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, perfectly! And he turns out
to be an exceptionally powerful medium.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>incredulously</i>] Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> It turns out that it has long been
noticed in the servants' hall. When he sits down to table,
the spoon springs into his hand of its own accord! [<i>To
the Professor</i>] Had you heard about it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> No, I had not heard that detail.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>to the Professor</i>]. But still, you admit the possibility
of such phenomena?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> What phenomena?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Well, spiritualistic, mediumistic, and supernatural
phenomena in general.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> The question is, what do we consider supernatural?
When, not a living man but a piece of stone
attracted a nail to itself, how did the phenomena strike the
first observers? As something natural? Or supernatural?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Well, of course; but phenomena such as the
magnet attracting iron always repeat themselves.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> It is just the same in this case. The phenomenon
repeats itself and we experiment with it. And
not only that, but we apply to the phenomena we are
investigating the laws common to other phenomena.
These phenomena seem supernatural only because their
causes are attributed to the medium himself. But that
is where the mistake lies. The phenomena are not caused
by the medium, but by psychic energy acting through a
medium, and that is a very different thing. The whole
matter lies in the law of equivalents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187">187</a></span>
<span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Yes, certainly, but&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><i>Enter T&aacute;nya, who hides behind the hangings.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Only remember that we cannot
reckon on any results with certainty, with this medium
any more than with Home or Kaptch&iacute;tch. We may not
succeed, but on the other hand we may even have perfect
materialisation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> Materialisation even? What do you mean by
materialisation?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Why, I mean that some one who is
dead&mdash;say, your father or your grandfather&mdash;may appear,
take you by the hand, or give you something; or else
some one may suddenly rise into the air, as happened to
Alex&eacute;y Vlad&iacute;miritch last time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Of course, of course. But the chief thing
is the explanation of the phenomena, and the application
to them of general laws.</p>

<p><i>Enter the Fat Lady.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Anna P&aacute;vlovna has allowed me to join you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Very pleased.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Oh, how tired Grossman seems! He could
scarcely hold his cup. Did you notice [<i>to the Professor</i>]
how pale he turned at the moment he approached the
hiding-place? I noticed it at once, and was the first to
mention it to Anna P&aacute;vlovna.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Undoubtedly,&mdash;loss of vital energy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Yes, it's just as I say, one should not abuse
that sort of thing. You know, a hypnotist once suggested
to a friend of mine, V&eacute;ra K&oacute;nshin (oh, you know her,
of course)&mdash;well, he suggested that she should leave off
smoking,&mdash;and her back began to ache!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>trying to have his say</i>] The temperature and
the pulse clearly indicate&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> One moment! Allow me! Well, I said to
her: it's better to smoke than to suffer so with one's nerves.
Of course, smoking is injurious; I should like to give it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188">188</a></span>up myself, but, do what I will, I can't! Once I managed
not to smoke for a fortnight, but could hold out no longer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>again trying to speak</i>] Clearly proves&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Yes, no! Allow me, just one word! You
say, &ldquo;loss of strength.&rdquo; And I was also going to say that,
when I travelled with post-horses &hellip; the roads used
to be dreadful in those days&mdash;you don't remember&mdash;but I

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Allow me, just one word! The Slavophils

never to exaggerate anything! &ldquo;The golden mean,&rdquo; you

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> Not for the world! I'm awfully glad. Only

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well, I just hide, and then, when it's all dark, I
come out and do it. That's how.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY</span> [<i>pointing to threads</i>] And what is this for? You

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Miss Elizabeth, darling! I will confess it, but

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> What? How? What business?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190">190</a></span>
<span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well, you see, those peasants that came this

do it.&hellip; But how will you manage it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well, I thought, when they put out the lights,
I'll at once begin knocking and shying things about,
touching their heads with the threads, and at last I'll
take the paper about the land and throw it on the table.
I've got it here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> Well, and then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Why, don't you see? They will be astonished.
The peasants had the paper, and now it's here. I will
teach&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well, I'll teach him&nbsp;&hellip; [<i>Laughs so that she

one he can get hold of! Of course, not your father&mdash;he'd
never dare do that&mdash;but any one else; he'll squeeze till
it's signed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY</span> [<i>laughing</i>] But that's not the way it is done.
Mediums never do anything themselves.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Well, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> About that affair of mine as I spoke of.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>laughs</i>] I've made the match; yes,
I've made the match. The matter is settled; we have
shaken hands on it, only not had a drink on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191">191</a></span>
<span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>with a shriek</i>] Never! So it's all right?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Don't I tell you so? He says, &ldquo;I
shall consult the missus, and then, God willing&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Is that what he said? [<i>Shrieks</i>] Dear Theodore
Iv&aacute;nitch, I'll pray for you all the days of my life!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> All right! All right! Now is not
the time. I've been ordered to arrange the room for the
s&eacute;ance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Let me help you. How's it to be arranged?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> How? Why, the table in the
middle of the room&mdash;chairs&mdash;the guitar&mdash;the accordion.
The lamp is not wanted, only candles.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>helps Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch to place the things</i>] Is that
right? The guitar here, and here the inkstand. [<i>Places
it</i>] So?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Can it be true that they'll make
Simon sit here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> I suppose so; they've done it once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Wonderful! [<i>Puts on his pince-nez</i>]
But is he clean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> How should I know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Then, I'll tell you <ins title="what . .">what&nbsp;&hellip;</ins></p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Yes, Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Go and take a nail-brush and some
Pears' soap; you may take mine &hellip; and go and cut his
claws and scrub his hands as clean as possible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> He can do it himself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Well then, tell him to. And tell
him to put on a clean shirt as well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> All right, Theodore Iv&aacute;nitch. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>sits down in an easy-chair</i>] They're
educated and learned&mdash;Alex&eacute;y Vlad&iacute;miritch now, he's a
professor&mdash;and yet sometimes one can't help doubting
very much. The people's rude superstitions are being
abolished: hobgoblins, sorcerers, witches.&hellip; But if one
considers it, is not this equally superstitious? How is it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192">192</a></span>possible that the souls of the dead should come and talk,
and play the guitar? No! Some one is fooling them, or
they are fooling themselves. And as to this business with
Simon&mdash;it's simply incomprehensible. [<i>Looks at an album</i>]
Here's their spiritualistic album. How is it possible to
photograph a spirit? But here is the likeness of a Turk

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>rising leisurely</i>] Quite ready. [<i>Smiles</i>]
Only I don't know about your new medium. I hope he
won't disgrace you, Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> No, I and Alex&eacute;y Vlad&iacute;miritch have
tested him. He is a wonderfully powerful medium!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Well, I don't know. But is he
clean enough? I don't suppose you have thought of
ordering him to wash his hands? It might be rather
inconvenient.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> His hands? Oh yes! They're not
clean, you think?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> What can you expect? He's a
peasant, and there will be ladies present, and M&aacute;rya
Vas&iacute;levna.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> It will be all right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> And then I have something to report
to you. Timothy, the coachman, complains that he can't
keep things clean because of the dogs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH</span> [<i>arranging the things on the table absent-mindedly</i>]
What dogs?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> The three hounds that came for
Vas&iacute;ly Leon&iacute;ditch to-day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH</span> [<i>vexed</i>] Tell Anna P&aacute;vlovna! She

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> 'Tis just as she likes, let her do as

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> I was ordered to come.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, it's all right. Let me see your
hands. That will do, that will do very well! Well then,
my good fellow, you must do just as you did before,&mdash;sit
down, and give way to your mood. But don't think at all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Why should I think? The more one thinks,
the worse it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Just so, just so, exactly! The less
conscious one is, the greater is the power. Don't think,
but give in to your mood. If you wish to sleep, sleep; if
you wish to walk, walk. Do you understand?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> How could one help understanding? It's simple
enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> But above all, don't be frightened.
Because you might be surprised yourself. You must
understand that just as we live here, so a whole world of
invisible spirits live here also.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH</span> [<i>improving on what Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON</span> [<i>laughs</i>] How can one help understanding! It's
very plain as you put it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> You may rise up in the air, or something
of the kind, but don't be frightened.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Why should I be frightened? That won't matter
at all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Well then, I'll go and call them

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> They are downstairs. I'll bring
them. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> All right then. So don't be afraid,

that off. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> She tells me to do the same again, and she will
again shy things about. How isn't she afraid?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Shsh!&hellip; They'll hear! There, stick these
matches on your fingers as before. [<i>Sticks them on</i>] Well,
do you remember everything?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON</span> [<i>bending his fingers in, one by one</i>] First of all, wet
the matches and wave my hands about, that's one. Then
make my teeth chatter, like this &hellip; that's two. But
I've forgotten the third thing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> And it's the third as is the chief thing. Don't
forget as soon as the paper falls on the table&mdash;I shall
ring the little bell&mdash;then you do like this.&hellip; Spread
your arms out far and catch hold of some one, whoever
it is as sits nearest, and catch hold of him. And then
squeeze! [<i>Laughs</i>] Whether it's a gentleman or a lady, it's
all one; you just squeeze 'em, and don't let 'em go,&mdash;as if
it were in your sleep, and chatter with your teeth, or else
howl like this. [<i>Howls sotto-voce</i>] And when I begin to play
on the guitar, then stretch yourself as if you were waking
up, you know.&hellip; Will you remember everything?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Yes, I'll remember, but it is too funny.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> But mind you don't laugh. Still, it won't
matter much if you do laugh; they'd think it was in your
sleep. Only take care you don't really fall asleep when
they put out the lights.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> No fear, I'll pinch my ears.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Aacute;NYA.</span> Well then Sim darling, only mind do as I tell
you, and don't get frightened. He'll sign the paper, see

power in that department than I.&hellip; Ant&oacute;n Bor&iacute;sitch!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN.</span> Ladies and gentlemen, I am not, strictly
speaking, a spiritualist. I have only studied hypnotism. It
is true I have studied hypnotism in all its known manifestations;
but what is called spiritualism, is entirely unknown
to me. When a subject is thrown into a trance, I may
expect the hypnotic phenomena known to me: lethargy,
abulia, an&aelig;sthesia, analgesia, catalepsy, and every kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198">198</a></span>susceptibility to suggestion. Here it is not these but
other phenomena we expect to observe. Therefore it
would be well to know of what kind are the phenomena
we expect to witness, and what is their scientific significance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> I thoroughly agree with Mr. Grossman. Such
an explanation would be very interesting.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> I think Alex&eacute;y Vlad&iacute;miritch will
not refuse to give us a short explanation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Why not? I can give an explanation if it is
desired. [<i>To the Doctor</i>] Will you kindly note his temperature
and pulse? My explanation must, of necessity, be
cursory and brief.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, please; briefly, quite briefly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> All right. [<i>Takes out thermometer</i>] Now then,
my lad&nbsp;&hellip; [<i>Places the thermometer</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Yes, sir!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>rising and addressing the Fat Lady&mdash;then
reseating himself</i>] Ladies and gentlemen! The phenomenon
we are investigating to-night is regarded, on the
one hand, as something new; and, on the other, as
something transcending the limits of natural conditions.
Neither view is correct. This phenomenon is not new
but is as old as the world; and it is not supernatural but
is subject to the eternal laws that govern all that exists.
This phenomenon has been usually defined as &ldquo;intercourse
with the spirit world.&rdquo; That definition is inexact.
Under such a definition the spirit world is contrasted with
the material world. But this is erroneous; there is
no such contrast! Both worlds are so closely connected
that it is impossible to draw a line of demarcation, separating
the one from the other. We say, matter is composed
of molecules&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETR&Iacute;STCHEF.</span> Prosy matter! [<i>Whispering and laughter</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>pauses, then continues</i>] Molecules are composed
of atoms, but the atoms, having no extension, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199">199</a></span>in reality nothing but the points of application of forces.
Strictly speaking, not of forces but of energy, that same
energy which is as much a unity and just as indestructible
as matter. But matter, though one, has many different
aspects, and the same is true of energy. Till recently
only four forms of energy, convertible into one another,
have been known to us: energies known as the dynamic,
the thermal, the electric, and the chemic. But these four
aspects of energy are far from exhausting all the varieties
of its manifestation. The forms in which energy may
manifest itself are very diverse, and it is one of these new
and as yet but little known phases of energy, that we are
investigating to-night. I refer to mediumistic energy.</p>

<p><i>Renewed whispering and laughter among the young people.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>stops and casts a severe look round</i>] Mediumistic
energy has been known to mankind for ages: prophecy,
presentiments, visions and so on, are nothing but manifestations
of mediumistic energy. The manifestations produced
by it have, I say, been known to mankind for ages.
But the energy itself has not been recognised as such till
quite recently&mdash;not till that medium, the vibrations of
which cause the manifestations of mediumistic energy,
was recognised. In the same way that the phenomena
of light were inexplicable until the existence of an
imponderable substance&mdash;an ether&mdash;was recognised, so
mediumistic phenomena seemed mysterious until the now
fully established fact was recognised, that between the
particles of ether there exists another still more rarified
imponderable substance not subject to the law of the
three dimensions&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><i>Renewed laughter, whispers, and giggling.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>again looks round severely</i>] And just as mathematical
calculations have irrefutably proved the existence
of imponderable ether which gives rise to the phenomena
of light and electricity, so the successive investigations
of the ingenious Hermann, of Schmidt, and of Joseph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200">200</a></span>Schmatzhofen, have confirmed beyond a doubt the existence
of a substance which fills the universe and may be called
spiritual ether.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Ah, now I understand. I am so grateful&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, but Alex&eacute;y Vlad&iacute;miritch, could
you not &hellip; condense it a little?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>not heeding the remark</i>] And so, as I have just
had the honour of mentioning to you, a succession of strictly
scientific experiments have made plain to us the laws of
mediumistic phenomena. These experiments have proved
that, when certain individuals are plunged into a hypnotic
state (a state differing from ordinary sleep only by the
fact that man's physiological activity is not lowered by the
hypnotic influence but, on the contrary, is always heightened&mdash;as
we have recently witnessed) when, I say, any
individual is plunged into such a state, this always produces
certain perturbations in the spiritual ether&mdash;perturbations
quite similar to those produced by plunging a solid
body into liquid matter. These perturbations are what we
call mediumistic phenomena&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><i>Laughter, and whispers.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> That is quite comprehensible and correct; but
if, as you are kind enough to inform us, the plunging of
the medium into a trance produces perturbations of the
spiritual ether, allow me to ask why (as is usually supposed
to be the case in spiritualistic s&eacute;ances) these perturbations
result in an activity on the part of the souls of dead
people?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> It is because the molecules of this spiritual
ether are nothing but the souls of the living, the dead,
and the unborn, and any vibration of the spiritual ether
must inevitably cause a certain vibration of its atoms.
These atoms are nothing but human souls, which enter
into communication with one another by means of these
movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201">201</a></span>
<span class="speaker">FAT LADY</span> [<i>to Sah&aacute;tof</i>] What is it that puzzles you? It
is so simple.&hellip; Thank you so, so much!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> I think everything has now been
explained, and that we may commence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR.</span> The fellow is in a perfectly normal condition:
temperature 37 decimal 2, pulse 74.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>takes out his pocket-book and notes this down</i>]
What I have just had the honour of explaining will be
confirmed by the fact, which we shall presently have an
opportunity of observing, that after the medium has been
thrown into a trance his temperature and pulse will inevitably
rise, just as occurs in cases of hypnotism.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, yes. But excuse me a moment.
I should like to reply to Serg&eacute;y Iv&aacute;nitch's question: How
do we know we are in communication with the souls of
the dead? We know it because the spirit that appears,
plainly tells us&mdash;as simply as I am speaking to you&mdash;who
he is, and why he has come, and whether all is well with
him! At our last s&eacute;ance a Spaniard, Don Castillos, came
to us, and he told us everything. He told us who he was,
and when he died, and that he was suffering for having
taken part in the Inquisition. He even told us what was
happening to him at the very time that he was speaking
to us, namely, that at the very time he was talking to us
he had to be born again on earth, and, therefore, could
not continue his conversation with us.&hellip; But you'll see
for yourselves&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] Oh, how interesting! Perhaps the
Spaniard was born in one of our houses and is a baby now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Quite possibly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> I think it is time we began.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> I was only going to say&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> It is getting late.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Very well. Then we will commence.
Ant&oacute;n Bor&iacute;sitch, be so good as to hypnotise the
medium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202">202</a></span>
<span class="speaker">GROSSMAN.</span> What method would you like me to use?
There are several methods. There is Braid's system,
there is the Egyptian symbol, and there is Charcot's
system.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH</span> [<i>to the Professor</i>] I think it is quite
immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Quite.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN.</span> Then I will make use of my own method,
which I showed in Odessa.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> If you please!</p>

<p><i>Grossman waves his arms above Simon. Simon closes his
eyes and stretches himself.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN</span> [<i>looking closely at him</i>] He is falling asleep!
He is asleep! A remarkably rapid occurrence of hypnosis.
The subject has evidently already reached a state
of an&aelig;sthesia. He is remarkable,&mdash;an unusually impressionable
subject, and might be subjected to interesting
experiments!&hellip; [<i>Sits down, rises, sits down again</i>]
Now one might run a needle into his arm. If you
like&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>to Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>] Do you notice how the
medium's trance acts on Grossman? He is beginning to
vibrate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, yes &hellip; can the lights be extinguished
now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> But why is darkness necessary?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Darkness? Because it is a condition of the
manifestation of mediumistic energy, just as a given
temperature is a condition necessary for certain manifestations
of chemical or dynamic energy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> But not always. Manifestations
have been observed by me, and by many others, both by
candlelight and daylight.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] May the lights be put out?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> A thread! A thread! We have
been witnessing manifestations more important than a
thread.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> I don't know. At all events, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je r&eacute;serve mon

an illusion, but afterwards it became clearer and clearer,

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF.</span> I can only speak of what I have seen. I did
not see that&mdash;nothing of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> You don't mean to say so? Why, it was quite
plainly visible! And to the left there was a monk clothed
in black bending over it&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SAH&Aacute;TOF</span> [<i>moves away. Aside</i>] What exaggeration!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY</span> [<i>addressing the Doctor</i>] You must have seen it!
It rose up from your side.</p>

<p><i>Doctor goes on counting pulse without heeding her.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY</span> [<i>to Grossman</i>] And that light, the light around
it, especially around its little face! And the expression so
mild and tender, something so heavenly! [<i>Smiles tenderly
herself</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GROSSMAN.</span> I saw phosphorescent light, and objects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209">209</a></span>changed their places, but I saw nothing more than
that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Don't tell me! You don't mean it! It is
simply that you scientists of Charcot's school do not believe
in a life beyond the grave! As for me, no one could
now make me disbelieve in a future life&mdash;no one in the
world!</p>

<p><i>Grossman moves away from her.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> No, no, whatever you may say, this is one of
the happiest moments of my life! When I heard Sarasate
play, and now.&hellip; Yes! [<i>No one listens to her. She goes
up to Simon</i>] Now tell me, my friend, what did you feel?
Was it very trying?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON</span> [<i>laughs</i>] Yes, ma'm, just so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FAT LADY.</span> Still not unendurable?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SIMON.</span> Just so, ma'm. [<i>To Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch</i>] Am I to
go?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Yes, you may go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">DOCTOR</span> [<i>to the Professor</i>] The pulse is the same, but the
temperature is lower.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Lower! [<i>Considers awhile, then suddenly
divines the conclusion</i>] It had to be so&mdash;it had to descend!
The dual influence crossing had to produce some kind
of reflex action. Yes, that's it!</p>

There's refreshments for the footmen every time they've

<p><span class="speaker">BETSY.</span> I'll try to come.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">OLD PRINCESS.</span> Then tell your papa that I don't believe

daughter. Betsy goes upstairs</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> I don't like putting on an old woman's overshoes
for her; she can't stoop, can't see her shoe for her
stomach, and keeps poking her foot in the wrong place.
It's different with a young one; it's pleasant to take her
foot in one's hand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND FOOTMAN.</span> Hear him! Making distinctions!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST FOOTMAN.</span> It's not for us footmen to make such
distinctions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Why shouldn't one make distinctions; are
we not men? It's they think we don't understand!
Just now they were deep in their talk, then they look at
me, and at once it's &ldquo;lay zhon!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND FOOTMAN.</span> And what's that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Oh, that means, &ldquo;Don't talk, they understand!&rdquo;
It's the same at table. But I understand! You
say, there's a difference? I say there is none.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST FOOTMAN.</span> There is a great difference for those
who understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213">213</a></span>
<span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> There is none at all. To-day I am a footman,
and to-morrow I may be living no worse than they are.
Has it never happened that they've married footmen?
I'll go and have a smoke. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND FOOTMAN.</span> That's a bold young man you've got.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> A worthless fellow, not fit for
service. He used to be an office boy and has got spoilt.
I advised them not to take him, but the mistress liked
him. He looks well on the carriage when they drive
out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST FOOTMAN.</span> I should like to send him to our Count;
he'd put him in his place! Oh, he don't like those
scatterbrains. &ldquo;If you're a footman, be a footman and
fulfil your calling.&rdquo; Such pride is not befitting.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETR&Iacute;STCHEF.</span> Most certainly. At the re-her-Sall and

<p><span class="speaker">PETR&Iacute;STCHEF.</span> Screamingly funny! There was a peasant,

is ungainly. And now they've gone and told tales about
him for letting some peasants into the kitchen yesterday.
It is a bad look-out: they may dismiss him. And he is
a good fellow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SECOND FOOTMAN.</span> What peasants were they?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> Peasants that had come from our
Koursk village to buy some land. It was night, and they
were our fellow-countrymen, one of them the father of
the butler's assistant. Well, so they were asked into the
kitchen. It so happened that there was thought-reading
going on. Something was hidden in the kitchen, and
all the gentlefolk came down, and the mistress saw the
peasants. There was such a row! &ldquo;How is this,&rdquo; she
says; &ldquo;these people may be infected, and they are let into
the kitchen!&rdquo; &hellip; She is terribly afraid of this infection.</p>

chief business, nowadays, is fumigating, washing, and
sprinkling.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FIRST FOOTMAN.</span> I see. That's why there is such a stuffy
smell here. [<i>With animation</i>] I don't know what we're
coming to with these infection notions. It's just detestable!
They seem to have forgotten the Lord. There's
our master's sister, Princess Mosol&oacute;va, her daughter was
dying and, will you believe it, neither father nor mother
would come near her! So she died without their having
taken leave of her. And the daughter cried, and called
them to say good-bye&mdash;but they didn't go! The doctor
had discovered some infection or other! And yet their
own maid and a trained nurse were with her, and nothing
happened to them; they're still alive!</p>

so I just moved him aside a bit, just so, with my hand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> A nice little bit! He's almost caved my ribs

<p><span class="speaker">THEODORE IV&Aacute;NITCH.</span> May I explain it to you, ma'am?
I must tell you Simon is not indifferent to T&aacute;nya, and
is engaged to her. And Gregory&mdash;one must admit the
truth&mdash;does not behave properly, nor honestly, to her.
Well, so I suppose Simon got angry with him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Not at all! It is all his spite, because I have
discovered their trickery.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> What trickery?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> Why, at the s&eacute;ance. All those things, last
night,&mdash;it was not Simon but T&aacute;nya who did them! I saw
her getting out from under the sofa with my own eyes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> What is that? From under the sofa?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GREGORY.</span> I give you my word of honour. And it was
she who threw the paper on the table. If it had not
been for her the paper would not have been signed, nor
the land sold to the peasants.</p>

<p><i>Enter the Professor.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> How do you do, Anna P&aacute;vlovna? How do
you do, Miss Betsy? Leon&iacute;d Fy&oacute;doritch, I have brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224">224</a></span>you a report of the Thirteenth Congress of Spiritualists at
Chicago. An amazing speech by Schmidt!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> Oh, that is interesting!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> I will tell you something much more
interesting! It turns out that both you and my husband
were fooled by this girl! Betsy takes it on herself,
but that is only to annoy me. It was an illiterate peasant
girl who fooled you, and you believed it all. There were
no mediumistic phenomena last night; it was she [<i>pointing
to T&aacute;nya</i>] who did it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>taking off his overcoat</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> I mean that it was she who, in the
dark, played on the guitar and beat my husband on the
head and performed all your idiotic tricks&mdash;and she has
just confessed!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>smiling</i>] What does that prove?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> It proves that your mediumism is&mdash;tomfoolery;
that's what it proves!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR.</span> Because this young girl wished to deceive, we
are to conclude that mediumism is &ldquo;tomfoolery,&rdquo; as you
are pleased to express it? [<i>Smiles</i>] A curious conclusion!
Very possibly this young girl may have wished to deceive:
that often occurs. She may even have done something;
but then, what she did&mdash;<em>she</em> did. But the manifestations
of mediumistic energy still remain manifestations
of <em>mediumistic</em> energy! It is even very probable that
what this young girl did, evoked (and so to say solicited)
the manifestation of mediumistic energy,&mdash;giving it a
definite form.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANNA P&Aacute;VLOVNA.</span> Another lecture!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PROFESSOR</span> [<i>sternly</i>] You say, Anna P&aacute;vlovna, that this
girl, and perhaps this dear young lady also, did something;
but the light we all saw, and, in the first case the
fall, and in the second the rise of temperature, and Grossman's
excitement and vibration&mdash;were those things also
done by this girl? And these are facts, Anna P&aacute;vlovna,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225">225</a></span>facts! No! Anna P&aacute;vlovna, there are things which must
be investigated and fully understood before they can be
talked about, things too serious, too serious&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LEON&Iacute;D FY&Oacute;DORITCH.</span> And the child that M&aacute;rya Vas&iacute;levna
